# VideoGameLair

A catalog of my favorite video games organized by both platform and publisher. I have used XML, XSLT, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this project. This project is basically just a small website that shows a table of information pertaining to some of my video games. Each page organizes the information in a different way (ie: by ID, by title, by platform, etc). 

Languages: JavaScript, CSS
Other Programs: XAMPP (Apache2)
Markup Languages: HTML, XML, XSLT,
